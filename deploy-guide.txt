# NEXORA DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## Current Status:
- ✅ Frontend UI: Complete & running (localhost:5175)
- ⚠️  Solana Program: Build blocked by blake3 dependency issue
- ⚠️  Devnet SOL: Need airdrop (rate limited)

## Quick Workaround - Use Mock Mode:

The app already has arcium-mock.ts that simulates MXE! 
Just need to mock the Solana program calls too.

## Or: Alternative Deployment:

1. Use Solana Playground (browser-based):
   - Go to https://beta.solpg.io
   - Import programs/nexora/src/lib.rs
   - Build & deploy online (they have updated toolchain)
   - Copy deployed program ID
   - Update in app/src/contexts/NexoraContext.tsx

2. Use Docker with proper Rust version:
   - solanalabs/solana:latest image has compatible toolchain

## Technical Issue:
blake3 v1.8.3 requires edition2024 (Rust nightly unreleased feature)
Solana CLI ships with cargo 1.84.0 which doesn't support it yet
